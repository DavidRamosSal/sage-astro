Using SageManifolds to do GR calculations for compact objects
**Principal areas that need work:**
* Implement Bondi's scheme correctly using charts on the manifold
* Exterior Vaidya metric
* Check for ways to implement junction conditions
* Conservation laws, TOV and solutions 
* Mass function, Weyl tensor and Tolman-Whittaker mass
